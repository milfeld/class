These instructions and directories were obtained from:
    git clone http://github.com/milfeld/class

Instructions:

Try the commands in each file:
1.) cut and paste the commands after the gnuplot promt, then
2.) execute "plot sin(x)", "plot exp(-x)", or something simple

The file name and purpose of each file are:

fonts   # shows how to set font on terminal line,
          and scale fonts

canvas  # term cmd shows how to set the size of the canvas (in points)
        # size cmd shows how to scale the size of the plot on the canvas.
        # origin cmd shows how to position plot on the canvas.

smooth  # The plot uses the smooth.dat (generated from an excel document)
        # Can you make acsplines do a better job.
          Help at http://lowrank.net/gnuplot/plot2-e.html#5.8
          e.g. use 1.0 as the weight instead of column 3


Try saving all of the commands you have entered with the command:

gnuplot>  save "my_interactive_cmds"

The the number of default setting is probably over-powering.
Your commands, along with other defaults that are applied are
within the list.  Use this file to get back to where you left off,
by loading it back up in a new gnuplot session.

gnuplot>  load 'my_interactive_cmds'
