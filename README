These instructions and directories were obtained from:

    git clone http://github.com/milfeld/class

Instructions:


In each of the following directories there is
a do file. They have the gnuplot commands to
create a plot.  Any special instructions are 
included in a README file in the directory.

Use the commands in the do files to create
a gnuplot.  Perform them in the following order:

basics
function  
hist  
multiplot  
smooth
param
splot
png

There are 4 ways to generate the plots.

1.) This is the simple way.
    cat the "do" file:  

    $ cat do

    highlight the listed commands into your copy buffer. 
    Execute gnuplot:
    
    $ gnuplot

    At the gnuplot prompt, paste the commands.

    gnuplot>       <-----PASTED COMMANDS HERE

 -------------------------------------------------- 

2.) Enter the command individually.

    List the command in the "do" file:  

    $ cat do

    Execute gnuplot:
    
    $ gnuplot

    At the gnuplot prompt type in each commands

    gnuplot>       <-----Type in each command


3.) Run the commands as a batch script.

    Execute gnuplot:
    
    $ gnuplot

    Load up the do file at the gnuplot prompt:

    gnuplot>  load 'do'

4.) Run the commands as an argument to gnuplot command.

    copy the "do" file to "do_cmdline"
    At the end of do_cmdline add:  

    pause -1 "Hit any key to continue"

    include the do_cmdline file name on the gnuplot command line:
    
    $ gnuplot do_cmdline

There is actually another way to do this by executing a file
with the commands in them,  e.g. something like "do_cmd" will
execute the plot.  See the instructions in the smooth directory.
